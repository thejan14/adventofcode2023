# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) 2023 contribution! The solutions are written in C++23 using CMake, Ninja and the MSVC compiler on Windows. When writing the solutions code I primarily aim for readability but try to always keep performance considerations in mind (thought the latter strongly depends on how much time I can spend). Happy reading!

## What is Advent of Code?
Advent of code is made by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz).

> [It is] an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

For more information see [about Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/) with the [Desktop development with C++](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/vscpp-step-0-installation?view=msvc-170) workload installed. Open the repository folder in Visual Studio, select the .cpp file you want to run and hit F5.
